/** \tutorial3
Introduction
------------
In this tutorial, we will create a simple tracker to track red objects in an image. The processing is similar to \ref tutorial1, but we also add a temporal filtering to remove false detections. The image processing is as follows:
- Apply a binary threshold in the red channel of image.
- Apply an erosion to eliminate small blobs.
- Filter blobs that were not detected in the last 5 frames.
- Find the center of blobs.
The tracker returns a vector of points. The image bellow depicts an example.

Objectives
------------------
- Show how to implement and use the Tracker<TImg,TObj> interface.


Steps
----------
1) Create an empty project in Qt Creator.
2) Add a cpp file and create a main function.
3) Include CvWorks header (\ref VisionCore.h) in your project. 4) Include OpenCv headers: imageproc.h, ...
5) Link OpenCv libraries: imagproc.lib ....
6) ...
