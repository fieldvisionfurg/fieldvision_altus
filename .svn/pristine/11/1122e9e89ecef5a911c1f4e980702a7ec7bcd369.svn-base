Introduction
------------
In this tutorial, we will create a simple detector, using the Detector interface, to find red objects in an image. The image processing is as follows:
- Apply a binary threshold in the red channel of image.
- Apply an erosion to eliminate small blobs.
- Find the center of blobs.
The detector output is a list of points containing the blobs center. The image bellow depicts an example.

Objectives
------------------
- Learn how to create a new C++ project including OpenCv library and CvWorks framework. 
- Show how to implement and use the Detector<TImg,TObj> interface.


Steps
----------
1) Create an empty project in Qt Creator.
2) Add a cpp file and create a main function.
3) Include CvWorks header (\ref VisionCore.h) in your project. This header defines all CvWorks interfaces and contains general implementations for usefull tasks and methods.
4) Include OpenCv headers: imageproc.h, ...
5) Link OpenCv libraries: imagproc.lib ....
6) Add the code to load an image with OpenCv.
7) Create a class derived from Detector<cv::Mat,cv::Rect> to process an image and detect the red objects. This is the most important  step of this tutorial. The Detector interface defines a single function 'detect' that needs to be implemented.
8) Instanciate the detector and perform a detection.
